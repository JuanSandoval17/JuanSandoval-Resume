        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current undergraduate student studying at the University of California, Riverside to achieve a bachelors degree in Liberal Studies and pursue a career as am educator at Elementary Schools after I receive my teaching credentials. Ever since I was young I knew I wanted to pursue this specific career as I saw my older sister pursue the same career and become an Elementary School teacher. Every time I have free time I go visit her classroom and get first hand experience as to how everything is run, and by then I knew that this is what I wanted to do with my life. I chose to attend the University of California, Riverside because of the amazing programs they run when it comes to receiving an education to become an early childhood educator. Seeing how the kids lit up when learning new exciting things reminded me of my past when I was their age and how much school helped me develop in life and keep me on the right track to success. I knew I wanted to give kids the same bright outlook on life that school game me. <br><br>

        I grew up in a very underprivileged small town in Southern Los Angeles in a family of freshly immigrated parents that came to the United States to start a prosperous life for their children. We lived penny to penny most days and learned to live graciously and do the most with what we had. I know what it's like going to the lowest quality elementary schools in a relatively gang infested neighborhood to live out your childhood and try and receive an education. I know what struggles those types of students had to deal with going from day to day in their personal and social lives. I want to be an educator for these types of kids to help them through these rough times and to prosper and be anything they want to be in their lives. I know a good educator sticks with someone and changes their lives such as some amazing teachers did for me in my early years and I want to be that person that maybe ignites a spark of creativity in someone or somehow get them excited to learn when they otherwise wouldn't be. This is why I'm pursuing what I'm pursuing.<br><br>

        In my free time I grew a particular love to short films and production and I hope to one day be able to create films of my own like I have in the past in high school or be able to implement what I have learned in producing short films to younger minds and teach it as an Art in whichever school has such programs. I believe young minds grow the most imaginative and creative ideas anyone could ever think of and if someone wants to express those ideas but don't know how, a short film could be the medium in which they express themselves. I could volunteer as a film teacher after I finish my regular job teaching at maybe an elementary or high school in a special after school program all about films. If I could pursue my main career as a teacher for Elementary School children and at the same time teach filming as well I would consider that a dream job and live a content life.
